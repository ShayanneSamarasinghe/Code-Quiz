# Code Quiz


## Usage 
This quiz application allows you to answer a set of basic question. During the quiz a timer of 200 seconds runs in the background. if the timer reaches 0 the quiz ends. If you answer wrong to a question you lose a 100 seconds of time. At the end of the quiz, whether the timer has rundown OR you have answered all the question, a tally will appear telling you how many you got right and wrong.
